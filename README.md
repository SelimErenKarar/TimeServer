# TimeServer
Creating a simple time server that takes a time request from a client using the “telnet” console command on a Linux machine. On socket communication, creating a server that takes date request from a client and send the correct date data that is requested.

The basic function of time server would be getting the inputs given above, using “date” command to generate correct output and returning the output to the client. For any other kind of input (including lowercase versions of above examples) just send “INCORRECT REQUEST” to the client without needing any further explanation.
